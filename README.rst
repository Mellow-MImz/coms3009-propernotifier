Project for COMS3009, Software Design, at the University of the Witwatersrand

System with which students could photograph their class notes, upload those photos to a cloud platform and have an OCR and layout recognition algorithm generate a latex version of those notes. They then could edit that latex as they see fit and sell their notes to other interested students through a note marketplace. Students could search for notes that they need as well as having a recommender system suggest notes related to their courses and interests while taking into account author ratings and reputations.
